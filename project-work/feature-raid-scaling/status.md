## Phase Notes

### IMPORTANT: Phase 1 is an AUDIT phase

The game-designer's first deliverable is **not code changes** — it is a
comprehensive scaling-status document cataloging every raid boss and raid-tier
quest chain across Classic through Luclin, with its current scaling state:

- Scaled by prior pass
- Partially scaled
- Untouched
- Special-case (requires unique handling)

**Prior work reference:** Overland/group content has an existing scaling pass.
The audit MUST cross-reference it to identify gaps where raid content was missed
or only partially addressed.

**USER DECISION GATE after Phase 1:** After the audit document is delivered and
approved, the user must be consulted before proceeding to Phase 2 (Classic raids).
The user will decide whether to continue as one sustained effort or split the era
phases (Classic, Kunark, Velious, Luclin) into separate projects.

### Phased delivery plan

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 — Audit | All raid bosses + raid quest chains catalogued with scaling status | **Complete 2026-04-21** |
| Phase 2 — Classic | Fear, Hate, Sky, Nagafen, Vox, dragons + Classic epic steps | Not Started |
| Phase 3 — Kunark | Trakanon, Veeshan's Peak + Kunark epic steps | Not Started |
| Phase 4 — Velious | NToV, ToV, Kael, Sleeper's Tomb, AoW, Velious dragons | Not Started |
| Phase 5 — Luclin | Ssraeshza, Vex Thal, Luclin raid content | Not Started |

## Handoff Log

_Record each handoff between agents with context and any notes._

### bootstrap-agent → design team (game-designer + lore-master)
- **Date:** 2026-04-21
- **Notes:** Workspace created. Feature brief at `feature-brief.md`. PRD template
  ready at `game-designer/prd.md`. Phase 1 deliverable is an audit document, not
  code. Spawn both agents as teammates for the Design phase.

### design team → user / architect (Phase 1 audit complete)
- **Date:** 2026-04-21
- **Deliverables:**
  - `game-designer/raid-scaling-audit.md` (2,400+ lines, ~127KB)
    — full per-era boss catalog + quest-chain summary + headline
    findings + 8 user decisions + quest-chain dependency graph
  - `game-designer/prd.md` — audit-driven design intent with 4
    mechanical levers (HP cut, damage cut, respawn, narrow ability
    trims) and appendix of architect technical notes
- **Key findings:**
  - Prior small-group-scaling pass (2026-02-23) explicitly excluded
    `raid_target = 1` from stat cuts — all ~140 true-boss encounters
    sit at PEQ defaults
  - True-boss count: ~30 Classic / 19 Kunark / 60-65 Velious / ~30
    Luclin (filtered from raw 878 raid_target NPCs)
  - HP gap ranges from 2× (Classic dragons) to 63× (Aten Ha Ra);
    damage one-shot outliers (Kilidna 4,600 max) require priority
    trimming
  - Prior pass DID touch loot and respawn for raid targets — respawn
    still at 54-130h vs. brief's 6-24h
- **User decisions requested before Phase 2:** 8 questions A-H
  (phased delivery strategy, VP variant, Hate layout, VT Yaemiu
  trash scope, respawn targets, Sleeper event, Cazic Thule era
  alignment, signature-mechanic preservation)
- **Lore-master participation note:** lore-master marked Tasks #7-10
  completed but did not produce detailed content. Game-designer
  wrote summary-level quest-chain sections from public-domain EQ
  knowledge to keep Phase 1 deliverable usable. Lore-master
  re-engagement recommended before Phase 4 implementation touches
  scripted event content (Ring War, VT internals, Sleeper event).
- **Ready for:** user decision gate → architect Phase 3 (triage
  + implementation plan for Phase 2 Classic raids, based on user's
  phased-delivery choice)

## Open Questions

_Questions that need answers before work can proceed. Tag the agent or
person responsible for answering._

| # | Question | Raised By | Assigned To | Status | Answer |
|---|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | After Phase 1 audit: continue as one project or split into per-era projects? | bootstrap-agent | user | **Pending user review** — audit recommends Option B (per-era) with Velious sub-split (4a non-ToV, 4b ToV+Sleeper+Vulak) and Luclin sub-split (5a non-VT, 5b VT+shard-rework) | TBD |
| 2 | Veeshan's Peak: keep revamp variants (108040-108053 at 454-814k HP) or switch to classic-era variants (108509-108517 at 144-192k HP)? | game-designer | user | Pending — audit recommends keeping revamp (scripts target them) with deep scaling | TBD |
| 3 | Plane of Hate: classic layout (hateplane) or revamp (hateplaneb)? | game-designer | user | Pending — needs in-game verification of which is live | TBD |
| 4 | Vex Thal Yaemiu elite trash (~80 mobs at 55-100k HP): include in scaling scope or leave? | game-designer | user | Pending | TBD |
| 5 | Respawn targets by tier (endgame/mid/low) — specific values? | game-designer | user | Pending — audit recommends 24h/12h/6h | TBD |
| 6 | Cazic Thule: leave at L70 with HP cut, or drop to L65 for Classic-era alignment? | game-designer | user | Pending | TBD |
| 7 | Vex Thal 13-shard key quest: reduce shard count for small-group server? | game-designer | user | Pending — high-impact quality-of-life decision; lore-master to weigh in | TBD |
| 8 | Coldain Ring War + Prayer Shawl event scripts: accept small-group scripted events or simplify wave counts? | game-designer | architect | Pending — requires script review | TBD |
| 9 | Signature mechanic preservation vs. small-group tractability (Vyemm MR wall, Aaryonar breath, Emperor add waves, etc.) | game-designer | user | Pending | TBD |
| 10 | Sleeper-awake event (Kerafyrm L99 3.5M HP): leave untouched (recommended) or change? | game-designer | user | Pending — audit recommends leave untouched | TBD |

## Decision Log

_Key decisions made during this feature's development._

| # | Decision | Made By | Date | Rationale |
|---|----------|---------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Deliver as phased project; Phase 1 is audit-only | user | 2026-04-21 | Scope too large for single pipeline run; audit first to understand gap before committing to full implementation |
| 2 | Trash/named mobs untouched; only raid bosses scaled | user | 2026-04-21 | Current named difficulty feels good; only raid tier needs adjustment |
| 3 | Loot tables unchanged; respawn timers reduced to 6-24h range | user | 2026-04-21 | Keep loot piñata feel; reduce lockout friction for small group |
